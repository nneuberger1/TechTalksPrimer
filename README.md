# The TechTalksPrimer Sample

This repository will help you learn some basic things about most typical software used within an iOS application.

### What you need for most development...

This will be a required list for most development.

* macOS (Catalina) Version 10.5

  + I have copies of XCode 10.0 - 11.2 if you need it on a portable hard drive.

### Samples Git Hub Projects Used:

Here's a list of sample project that I used to help build this sample application.

* https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-ios-samples/tree/master/IoT-Sample/Swift

Sample package manager upcoming for XCode and Swift, that may be a better long term replacement to CocoaPods

* https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/creating_a_swift_package_with_xcode

A good article announcing Apple's Swift programming language is now open source
